Wow! U found the silly!

Your prize?

Have this stock image ig

![A stock image of Java code. The code is riddled with errors, many of which are highlighted by the IDE. 
The code defines a class named Second in the package com.code.test. 
In the class is a public method named "printInfo" which takes a "User" object and returns void.
The method first prints the name of the user. Next it gets the address of the user and assigns it to the variable "adress".
It then defines two primitive integer variables named "a" and "b". "a" is 3 and "b" is 7.
It then runs a loop that will run as long as a is less than b, b is more than a, and a is less than b.
Within the loop, the method repeatedly prints out (without a newline) the state, city, street, and home number of the user's address.
The image is cut off, so it's unclear if the loop ever prints a newline, or even changed a or b to terminate itself.
It's also worth noting that the class doesn't seem to have a constructor, and the printInfo method could probably be static.
